                <h2>What is Revolution Force?</h2>
				<h3>More than 3000 offers in over 150 nations</h3>
				<p>Revolution Force is a Performance Marketing Agency or a CPA (cost per action) network that helps publishers and affiliates monetize their traffic by connecting them with merchant web sites and brands that share revenue and profit when a user completes an action. Affiliates can be crowd sourced into a single stream to achieve the highest commission tier, while advertisers have the opportunity to reach thousands of publishers by dealing with a single company and guaranteeing return on their advertising budget by only paying on successful user acquisition.</p> 
				<h2>Why should you partner with Revolution Force?</h2>
				<p>The affiliate network space is a red ocean of competitors and startups, where failures are more common than the successes and the experience. The majority of networks use a strategy of low salaries and high commissioned teams to insure their revenues and profits, taking both from affiliate and advertiser.</p>
				<p>Revolution Force's leaders are successful industry veterans and each one of them holds equity in our company. We've had personal relationships with a majority of our advertisers for more than a decade. We ensure their returns and work with them to develop new offers and brands from our experience. The top affiliates in our network are considered both partners and friends, and each new affiliate has an opportunity to be part of our philosophy of business. We have never missed a payment and we never will. This is more than a business to us, this is our lifestyle and our lifetime career.</p>

                <h1>Jeremy Wagshul</h1>
                <p>Interested in the apparently limitless capacity for growth in internet marketing, I decided to start learning how my skills could be put to use in this dynamic and ever-changing field. I promptly discovered the world of affiliate marketing and, eager to learn more, decided to dive in. Since social media seemed to be the most interesting way to generate organic traffic, I decided to start building content websites and quickly found success. However, that success only made me crave more. The obvious next step for me was to work inside of an affiliate network, which I did. As an affiliate manager at Click Dealer, I began managing different types of affiliates, working with various traffic sources, and gaining more insight into what advertisers wanted and how to help them achieve their goals.</p>
				<p>I realized I had found my passion and wanted to continue building on my knowledge and experience. As a result, when I was given the opportunity to join the team of veterans at Revolution Force, I knew what I had to do. With the support of a committed team and guidance of industry veterans, I now lead the affiliate team continue to succeed and to be inspired by the limitless capacity for growth in this industry.</p>

                <p>I started out as a webmaster in 1998 and single-handedly developed a traffic network producing seven-figures annually. Since then, I have continued to learn from and evolve with this ever-changing field, while working for major brands, such as AdultFriendFinder, Hustler, Vivid, ClickDealer, Upforit, and Together Networks. While my title has frequently changed, my drive has not.</p> 
				<p>Although I love the affiliate game, still manage my own personal affiliate portfolio, and continue to maintain relationships with the many affiliates, who I have had the opportunity to work with on a strategic level over the years, I have naturally migrated towards the role of business development because, as a veteran affiliate marketer, I have a deep understanding of how to help advertisers develop a marketing strategy that will enable them to reach their goals. As a result, I now lead a team of experienced and creative business development managers, whose sole focus is how to help our advertisers reach their target markets and continue to grow. Here at Revolution Force, I also take the opportunity to work with the development of our own proprietary performance software platform, Campaign Router.</p>

                <p>I was recruited by the founder of Cams.com in 2000, to bring a new company to profitability. In less than one year, I built an affiliate program that furnished the majority of the company's income and provided a foundation for its continued growth. That affiliate program became an industry model and lead to the merger between Cams.com and Adult Friend Finder in 2006. Following the merger, I constructed a Business Development team at FriendFinder Networks, which continued to flourish for the next six years. By building mutually beneficial relationships with our affiliates, my team and I fostered true business relationships and generated hundreds of millions of dollars. After deciding to assume a Vice President position, I continued to build on and refine this model, and our success continued. Committed to continuing to expand the reach of our network and build on this model, my team and I left FriendFinder networks in 2013, to join a new corporation. As an executive at Noosphere, I had the opportunity to work on development inside of Together Networks, UpForIt Networks, and ClickDealer.</p>
				<p>Anxious to put my own mark on the space, and create a new model for continued growth, I decided that I wanted to create a new network, built upon a continued commitment to fostering mutually beneficial relationships, and driven by the collaboration of a creative and energetic team of marketing veterans. In 2015, this dream was realized when I founded Revolution Force, a data driven affiliate network that believes in transparency, analytics, and leveraging marketing with technology while keeping a boutique feel with our partners.</p>

                <p>While in college, I was a member of the marketing team at a mobile app company. However, after earning my Bachelors in Economics, I decided I wanted to do something more numbers driven, to capitalize on my understanding of the marketplace and the analytic frameworks for interpreting it.  As a result, the transition to working as an affiliate manager seemed a natural progression. After researching the industry, and learning about the team of power players at Revolution Force, I knew that was where I wanted to be. After beginning as a student intern, I have since graduated, under the guidance of the Revolution Force team, to a senior affiliate manager, working to ensure the success of the many affiliates I have the opportunity to work with each day.</p>

I began experimenting with the reach and influence of social media by promoting events, products, and ideas on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and I was able to find channels that brought traction to my goals. During this process, I naturally discovered affiliate marketing, started testing my potential, and found success. Realizing that this market has almost unmeasurable size, I began pursuing a career in affiliate marketing, hoping to join team and see just where this experience, and my potential, could lead me.
